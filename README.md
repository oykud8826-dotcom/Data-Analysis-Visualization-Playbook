#  Data Analysis & Visualization Playbook

Welcome to my personal data analysis repository! 

As an **Economics student**, I am documenting my journey in mastering Python for data science. This repository contains my exercises, notes, and mini-projects focusing on data manipulation and visualization using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

##  Technologies & Tools
* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas:** Data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation.
* **Matplotlib:** Static visualizations (Line, Bar, Scatter, Pie charts).
* **NumPy:** Numerical computations.

##  Repository Contents

### 1. Data Manipulation with Pandas 
Scripts covering key concepts:
* Filtering and sorting datasets.
* Handling missing values (Data Cleaning).
* `Groupby` operations for statistical summaries.
* Merging and concatenating DataFrames.

### 2. Visualization with Matplotlib 
Visualizing economic and dummy data:
* **Line Plots:** Tracking trends over time.
* **Scatter Plots:** Analyzing correlations between variables.
* **Subplots:** Comparing multiple metrics in a single view.
* **Customization:** Adding legends, grids, and annotations for professional reporting.

##  Key Takeaways
Through these exercises, I have learned how to:
* Transform raw data into meaningful insights.
* Create professional-grade charts for reports.
* Automate repetitive Excel tasks using Python scripts.
